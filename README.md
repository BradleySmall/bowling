# Bowling Score Kata scores a bowling game.

## **Rules**
Bowling is played as a game of 10 frames. Each frame can consist of throwing once or twice depending on whether or not the first throw knocks down all the pins, with a special case of possible 3 times in the last frame. The frames are scored as the number of pins knocked down. However when all the pins are knocked down, the frame is bonused with either the additional number of pins in the next throw or the next two throws depending on how many rolls it took to knock them all down. The top score possible is 300. 

## **Code**
The source code is Java. Using gradle build. The unit tests, however, are currently using JUnit though they may later be converted to Spock. 

## **Suggestions**
This code is intended as an exercise for me to apply my learning of Java. I am quite open to suggestions and recommendations for improvement.

## **License**
If you wish to use any of this code for personal and/or educational purposes you may freely do so as long as you do not claim it as your own. Give a guy a little credit if you use his work.

If you wish to make money with this code, such as publishing it in a tutorial or making a salable product I want a cut of the action. As unlikely as this may be, simply contact me, so we can work out the details.
